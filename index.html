        <div id="about-me">
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Tess Kramer! I’m a recent Chapman University grad and currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at the University of San Diego.
                <br><br>
                I’ve had the incredible privilege of facilitating a data science in entertainment conference, where I got to connect with industry leaders and dive deep into the power of analytics in storytelling.
                <br><br>
                I’ve also worked with amazing companies to help drive their mission through data-driven strategies optimizing campaigns, spotting trends, and uncovering key insights.
                I’m all about blending creativity with numbers, and I can’t wait to keep exploring how data shapes the way we engage with the world!
